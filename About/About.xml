  <description>This mod is a pared down version of what was once called JecsTools. Due to lack of consistent support for defects and core game updates, I've taken over just the components of Jecs that are required to make the Rimhammer Mod Series (and any other mods I make / maintain) run properly.
  
  Adds modding components to RimWorld: spell casting, weapon slots, oversized weapons, and more!
  
  Note to players: This mod will not change your game, but rather it lets modders do more, so you can have an even more amazing RimWorld experience.
  
  Note to modders: This mod contains tools that allow you to do new and different things in RimWorld.
  
  List of components:

CompAbilityUser
 - Adds spell/ability casting to humanlikes.
 
PawnShields
 - Allows pawns to use physical hand held shields for defense.
 
CompOversizedWeapon
 - Allows weapons with graphic sizes that can be bigger than RimWorld's limits.
