  <description>This mod is a pared down version of what was once called JecsTools. Due to lack of consistent support for defects and core game updates, I've taken over just the components of Jecs that are required to make the Rimhammer Mod Series (and any other mods I make / maintain) run properly.
  
  Adds modding components to RimWorld: spell casting, weapon slots, oversized weapons, and more!
  
  Note to players: This mod will not change your game, but rather it lets modders do more, so you can have an even more amazing RimWorld experience.
  
  Note to modders: This mod is filled with lots of tools that allow you to do many new and different things in RimWorld.
  
  List of components:

CompAbilityUser
 - Adds spell/ability casting to humanlikes.
 
 -Shields
 
 -Oversized Weapons
 
 
 
 

CompActivatableEffect
 - Adds an activation graphic for weapons (e.g. lightsaber beam).

CompDeflector
 - Allows the ability to knock projectiles to melee weapons.

CompExtraSounds
 - Allows extra melee sounds to weapons.

CompLumbering
 - Makes a staggered walking animation. (e.g. ATST walking effect)

CompOversizedWeapon
 - Allows weapons with graphic sizes that can be bigger than RimWorld's limits.

CompSlotLoadable
 - Adds slots to objects that can be filled to have effects. (e.g. different ammo types for guns, crystals for lightsabers)

CompToggleDef (by Roxxploxx)
- Allows for something to despawn, change its def, and respawn.

CompVehicle (experimental for 1.0, removed for 1.1+)
 - Allows for a pawn to be treated as a vehicle that can be loaded with pilots, gunners, crew, and passengers.

CompInstalledPart (WIP)
- Allows installation and uninstallation of things onto other things. This is particularly useful for weapons on vehicles.
